# Portfolio Page

Hello I'm Andr√©, I'm a Web Developer and this is my portfolio page.

## Useful Commands

### Development

Run **live-server** and **sass** in **watch** mode and start coding!

```
npm start
```

### Production

Transpile sass and copy relevant files from **src** to **dist** to prepare your website for **deployment**.

```
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Github Pages

Deploy your code to **Github Pages**: this script creates a 'gh-pages' branch and publishes the **dist** folder. For this to work, make sure you already have a remote repository on github.

```
npm run deploy
```
